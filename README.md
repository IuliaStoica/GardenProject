# GardenProject

Check if you have Node.js and npm installed on  your computer:
  $ node -v
  $ npm -v
 
 If they are not already installed google instructions and install them.
 
 Run npm install, this will create the node_modules folder and install the needed packages specified in package.json.
 
 Run npm start to run the project in development mode. This should open a browser tab with a boat and a cat picture on a blue background.
